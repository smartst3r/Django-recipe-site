This is a recipe web app that uses input ingredients to search for what recipes you can make. 

This is the home page that displays recent recipes uploaded

###Background info
The reason I had this is because I would have a bunch of leftover ingredients and would wonder what I could make.
I have plans to move this to another site and do some web crawling to get loads of recipes.
 
#### I stopped work on this project as I am porting it to a website.
